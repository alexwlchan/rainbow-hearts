# rainbow-hearts

This is a tiny web app for generating rainbow hearts, based on [a graphic I made for Valentine's Day](https://twitter.com/alexwlchan/status/1360919253738790915):

> happy valentine’s day, especially to my fellow aro/ace peeps 🖤🤍💚💜

> ![A pair of interlocking hearts. The outline of the heart on the left is the colours of the asexual pride flag (black, grey, white, purple) and the outline of the heart on the right is the colours of the aromantic pride flag (green, light green, white, grey, black)](tweet.jpg)

It's based on a similar app I made to generate [rainbow Valknuts](https://rainbow-valknuts.glitch.me).
It randomly selects two flags to create hearts from, and then renders them as an SVG.

The app is running at <https://rainbow-hearts.glitch.me>, and the source code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/alexwlchan/rainbow-hearts).



## Usage

Clone this repository, then run `start.sh`.
This will install dependencies, then start the app running on <http://localhost:5000>:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/alexwlchan/rainbow-hearts.git
$ cd rainbow-hearts
$ ./start.sh
```

You need Python 3 installed.
